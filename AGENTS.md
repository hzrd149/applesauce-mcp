## CLI Usage and Cliffy Packages

This project uses the [Cliffy](https://cliffy.dev/) package suite to build a
user-friendly and robust CLI. Cliffy provides tools for command line interfaces,
including argument parsing, commands, prompts, and more. In our CLI entry point
(see `servers/code-snippets/src/cli.ts`), Cliffy helps structure commands like
`ingest` and `server`, making the CLI easy to extend and maintain.
